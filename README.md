# My Portfolio

Check it out here https://ohhnoo2150.github.io

## Description

Utilizing what we have learned so far in our coursework, creating a framework via HTML, applying styling with CSS and Bootstrap, applying javascript for functionality and flare. 
I have several cards on my landing page, an accordion on my about page, more cards on my projects page along with functioning buttons to run the program as well as see the repos. I have a weather ticker, a video and a map on my map page, which I sort of use as a little tool to drive people to wanting to visit Puerto Rico (hope you want to go too!)

the navbar buttons are custom made and animated by me, I want to learn how to do it through javascript and I will, but for expedience I created them with an image editor.
