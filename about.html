            <p>I grew up in San Antonio Texas to two Puerto Rican parents so I am 100% Boricua and proud of it.<br> I have traveled to some 27 countries all before the age of 18 as my father was a doctor and he loved to travel so he took us every where with
                him. I have seen much of the world and it's history. <br>I joined the United States Marine Corps in 1999 and served until 2003, I was with 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 1st Combat Engineer Battalion. After my service was completed I worked
                in a sleep lab for 5 years after which I decided to go back to school with aspirations of becoming a doctor. <br> I earned a degree in Epidemiology from The University of Texas at San Antonio in 2015 and continued my education into 2020
                my focus changed from medical school to nursing but my heart was not in it; but I know there are many ways to help people.</p>

            <p>After taking a break from school, with communication with my friends and family, I made the decision to dive head first into the world of web development. This has been a challenge for me, but I am enjoying it! <br>I've already made some friends
                (waves to his coding cohort) in this world who have been very helpful and motivating, I have found a Mentor (even though he's an Army veteran we get along, whats up Alex!). <br> I do my best to figure things out on my own but if I struggle
                I'm not ashamed to ask for help. I can tell that day by day my understanding of the concepts and information are increasing.<br>

            <p>I came into the program cold without any idea or knowledge on what I was getting myself into; so charting a path proved to be a little difficult, after some reflection and learning different web development pathways, I am zeroing in on penetration
                testing. <br>This journey is a long one, filled with many twist and turns, but I am here for it, and look forward to fully immersing myself in learning multiple coding languages to reach my objectives.<br>
