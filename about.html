                        where with him. I have seen much of the world and it's history. I joined the United States Marine Corps in 1999 and served until 2003, I was with 1st Battalion 5th Marines and 1st Combat Engineer Battalion. After my service was
                        completed I worked in a sleep lab for 5 years after which I decided to go back to school with aspirations of becoming a doctor <br> I earned a degree in Epidemiology from The University of Texas at San Antonio in 2015 and continued
                        my education into 2020 my focus changed from medical school to nursing but my heart was not in it; but I know there are many ways to help people.<br>

                                    After taking a break from school, with communication with my friends and family, I made the decision to dive head first into the world of web development.<br> this has been a challenge for me, but I am enjoying it!
                                    I've already made some friends in this world who have been very helpful, I have found a Mentor (even though he's an Army veteran we get along). I can tell that day by day my understanding of the concepts and information
                                    are increasing.

                                    I have developed a peer mentor (Hello There Alex!) who has helped me along the way, I came into the program cold without any idea or knowledge on what I was getting myself into; so charting a path<br> proved to be a
                                    little difficult, after some reflection and learning different web development pathways, I am zeroing in on penetration testing.<br> This journey is a long one, filled with many twist and turns, but I am here for it,
                                    and look forward to fully immersing myself in learning multiple coding languages to reach my goal.
